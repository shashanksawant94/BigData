## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans. Python is called as a general purpose programming language beacuse we can use python for creating various types of applications and in fields.
Python can be used to create console applications, web applications, desktop applicatons, data analysis, data science, machine learning, testing, scripting etc.
Python uses English like words as its syntax which is easier to understand and apply hence it's a high-level programming language.


Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans. Python is called a dynamically typed language because the data type of variable is decided at run time depending on the data that is stored in variable.
If the data of a variable changes then, the data type of varaible also gets changed.


Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Ans. Pros of Python programming language
Quick to learn.
Simple syntax.
It is platform independent.
Can be applied in various fileds like development, analysis, scripting, testing, etc.
It is huge library and community support.
Automatic garbage collection.

Cons of Python programming language
It is comparatively slower than compiled languages like C and C++.
Programmer does not have control on the memory used by the program, functions and variables.


Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
Ans. Python can be used in domains like Console based applications, Web based applications, Software testing, Data analysis and visualization, Task Automation, Data Science, Machine Learning, etc.


Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans. Variables are like a name to refer a data stored in memmory.
We can declare a variable as follows. name='Python'


Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
Ans. We can take input from user by using input() function in Python.
student_name=input('Enter your name: ')


Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
Ans. The default data type of the value taken as an input using input() function is str.


Q8. What is type casting?
Ans. Type casting is modifying the data type of a variable in run time while performing operation on it.


Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
Ans. Yes, we can take more than one input from the user using single input() function.
We need to use split() function after input() function.
By default splitting is done on whitespace but we can specify what can be used to split.
Ex. Accept 4 Languages from user.
lang1,lang2,lang3,lang4=input('Enter your four languages: ').split()
print(lang1,lang2,lang3,lang4)

Q10. What are keywords?
Ans. Keywords are reserved words in Python haing a meaning and its use already defined.


Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans. Keywords cannot be used as a variable.
Ex. for='python' cannot be done as 'for' is a keyword for 'for loop' and will give syntax error while using it as a variable.


Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Ans. Indentation is adding a space or spaces in beginning of line. Indentation is used in python to create a block.


Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Ans. We can throw some output in Python using print() function.


Q14. What are operators in Python?
Ans. Operators are symbols and keywords in Python which requires operands to perform operations.
Ex. 5+4 for additon, 5*4 for multiplication, 5>10 and 99>100 for comparison and logical operation.


Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Ans. / operator performs mathematical division to calcuate the result and // shows only integer part and ignores the decimal to calcuate the result.


Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
Ans.
print('iNeuron'*4)



Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
Ans.
number=int(input('Enter a number: '))
if number%2 == 0:
    print('Number',number,'is even')
else:
    print('Number',number,'is odd')



Q18. What are boolean operator?
Ans. Boolean opertors are those operators which give result as True or False.
Ex. ==, >, <, >=,<=, not

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0

0 and 0

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0
```
Ans.
1

0

False

1



Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
Ans. Conditional statements are the ones which are executed only if the mentioned condition is satisfied.


Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
Ans. 'if' is used to execute statements when a certain condition is satisfied.
'elif' stands for "else if". Its is used when the 'if' condition fails and we want another conditons to be checked further.
'else' is used when 'if' condition fails. 'else' is also used after 'elif' when none of the conditions are satisifed.


Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
Ans.
age=int(input('Enter your age to check eligiblity to vote: '))
if age>=18:
    print('"I can vote"')
else:
    print('''"I can't vote"''')


Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans.
sum=0
numbers=[12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
for i in numbers:
    if i%2==0:
        sum=sum+i
print(sum)



Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
Ans.
num1=int(input('Enter the first number: '))
num2=int(input('Enter the second number: '))
num3=int(input('Enter the third number: '))

if num1>num2 and num1>num3:
    print(num1,'is the greatest number')
elif num2>num1 and num2>num3:
    print(num2,'is the greatest numner')
else:
    print(num3,'is the greatest number')
    

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans.
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

for i in numbers:
    if i%5==0:
        if i>500:
            break
        elif i>150:
            continue
        else:
            print(i)
